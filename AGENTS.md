Project guidelines:

- This is a Python app.
- Package management uses `uv`.
- We follow TDD: always write tests first and ensure they pass.
- Always use types; do not skip typing.
- After any code change, always run the full test suite.
  - If a test fails, run only the failing tests to debug.
  - After fixing, always run the full test suite again.
